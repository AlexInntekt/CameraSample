   Language:   Swift 3

   Functionalities:  It's nothing more than a sample that proves how easy it is to implement the access to 
local camera and photo library in any app. 
   
   *When the user oppens up the app for the first time and tries to choose a picture from the phone's memory, an alert
is being displayed, asking explicitly the user to allow the access.
   *Tested on phisical device, on the simulator the access might still be restricted.
